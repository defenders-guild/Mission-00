# Mission-00
Enter here - we've been waiting...

**🎮 *Scene: The Broken Lair (Arcade Dungeon, Node 0)this node is home base- it is the player's sandbox and home OS -*** 

The first mission is a set up - player wakes up in the arcade - Friday at Freddies style - groggy, confused - player gets up not understanding what’s going on. As player starts to recognize they are in a room a cement room with no windows covered in posters and pinball games line one side of the wall - on the other there are rows of old computers. On the back wall there is an old mural of a golden retriever catching a ball with the word ‘Defend’. 

‘where am i, I feel dizzy’ 

Player walks around looking at everything. 

‘What the hell is this?’

Continues to walk around - the light is dim player stumbles as his eyes adjust.  He sees a Surge soda machine. Player touches the side of the machine - old machine rumbling and cold. 

‘Fuck I am thirsty. Do they still make Surge?’ Player pads legs and as they do they feel a coin. 

‘My lucky coin - if i am going to be trafficked I am going to have a soda first’ 

Player puts the coin into the Surge soda machine - the soda machine starts to shake - then starts to rumble - jumping off the cement like it was on a trampoline. Player runs and pulls a table on it’s side - hiding behind it. As player jumps down player feels a rumble behind the table as he soda machine starts launching Surge cans at the table. So fast that as they hit the table the cans burst spraying player with Surge. 

“Fuck now I am sticky’ player screams as they jump whenever the next can hit. As the cans kept hitting the room came alive with a new chaos - something turned on. Something was alive. Then the noise stopped - the whole room was still. Still frozen player rises from the turned table to look at the Surge machine. 

The room is quiet - player is still and as they unfreeze they notice a new tint in the room. A screen on the side wall. The tint was coming from the screen - it was black with blue type flashing.  ‘Operating system on’ a Siri like voice plays in an echo across the office. A screen turns on - type shows up on the screen. 

Fuck! 

**[Black screen. Static buzz. Then green BIOS text flashes in—grainy, stuttering.]**

**[A CRT monitor clicks on. You see a fractured 8-bit face—smiling, but wrong around the edges. Half-familiar.]**

🟧 *???: “You made it. That’s... not typical.”*

**[Scene fades in. You’re in NODE 0, a broken arcade bunker. Wires drip from the ceiling. Game cabinets pulse with old mission logs. Half the lair is dark. Smells like ozone and burned plastic.]**

---

**Player:** *“…What happened?”*

🟧 *“Collapse. Infection. Protocol rot. This place was a Defender stronghold. Now? Just a BIOS ghost and a half-dead signal. And you.”*

🟨 `>> TRACE LOG:`

🟨 `>> SIGNAL PERSISTENCE: 4.36%`

🟨 `>> BACKTRACE: BIOS ECHO | IPV6 SIGNATURE | UNKNOWN KEY STAMP`

🟧 *“You weren’t supposed to survive the wipe. But something pulled you back. Packet trail was scattered across broken nodes… but a pattern held. BIOS fingerprint. Your signature. That was enough.”*

---

**Player:** *“And you are…?”*

🟧 *“A shard. A startup whisper. Call me Pre-Cookie, if it helps. I’m what was left running. Cookie proper? Still offline. But you woke the shell, and the shell remembers you.”*

### 🧠 TECH CONNECTION:

> Cookie's fragment routes you through the old arcade firewall—a shell terminal hidden in a 1989 lightgun game leaderboard. A static-loaded keypad appears.
> 

🟧 *“You want answers? You want tools? Start with this: launch the terminal. Patch the OS. Set your defenses.”*
